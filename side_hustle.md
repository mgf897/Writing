# Side hustle business

Ideally should be a product, not a service (Gearside YT has a good video on this)

Why?
- Once a product is made it can be sold many times without additional effort

What makes a good product?
- Something that solves a problem

So what about fiction books and movies?
- Entertainment / Enjoyment 
- Lots of competition, harder to standout, harder to sell

So a product that solves a specific problem
